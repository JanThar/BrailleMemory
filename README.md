# BrailleMemory

Learning game for finding pairs of Braille and Black Letter, Mostly 3D-printed, with a RFID sticker glued inside the cards while printing after roughly two layers. RFID reader connected to an arduino with an Sparkfun MP3 Player shield on top. Alternative version: Using the Sparkfuns Text-To_Speech module instead. For the MP3 player one would use MP3 files for each letter on the SD card, labeled as letter.mp3.
